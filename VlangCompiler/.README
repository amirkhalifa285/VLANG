Vlang Compiler (Vlang → C++ Translator)
Amir Khalifa 

How It Works
Lexical Analysis: implemented via lexer.l (Flex)

Parsing and Code Generation: handled by parser.y (Bison/Yacc)

C++ Code Output: emitted as output.cpp

Final Executable: compiled using G++ into program.exe

🛠️ Build Instructions
Prerequisites
Windows OS (tested)

Flex & Bison for Windows

G++ (e.g., via MinGW)

Compile the Compiler

make
Generate C Output from Vlang Program

make generate
This will compile the vlang compiler and run:


vlang.exe < example.vlang
The resulting output.cpp is written to disk.

Compile the C++ Output

g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o program.exe output.cpp runtime.cpp
Or use the shortcut:


make test
Which performs:

Compilation of the compiler

Translation of the example

Compilation of the C++ code

Running the final program.exe
